Doors of Durin - Text Based LOTR Game

The Doors of Durin is a simple text based, Lord of the Rings themed, math game where you are given 2 numbers and asked to find the 3 numbers which
are the sum of the first number and the product of the second number.

This was my very first C++ project as I taught myself C++.

Thanks for Playing!
